In this exercise, I created a user interface that has three buttons relating to Rock, Paper, or Scissors. When the user chooses an option, the computer player randomly chooses one also and the result is displayed on the scoreboard. After 5 games are played, the system says whether the user or the computer has won.
I learned a lot while creating this game. I learned how to connect JavaScript to HTML variables so that changes made  to the JS code will be reflected on the website. I also learned more about CSS mechanics such as colors, fonts, and the movement of HTML variables.
